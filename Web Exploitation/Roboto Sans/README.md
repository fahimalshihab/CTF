The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it.

The text above disallow looks suspicious. The double equal sign suggests that it's base 64. However, if we try to decode it with an online decoder, it seems like the base 64 is a little malformed. As the base 64 text spans across three lines, it suggests that it is actually three separate strings. If we decode each line separately, we find that the second line gives us a valid path, specifically js/myfile.txt. If we navigate to the suburl, we get the flag.
