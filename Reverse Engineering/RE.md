# Reverse Engineering
Reverse Engineering in a CTF is typically the process of taking a compiled (machine code, bytecode) program and converting it back into a more human readable format.

## Reverse Engineering in CTF
- In these competitions, participants are given a piece of software or a system and are asked to reverse engineer it to find hidden flags or vulnerabilities.

## Problems

Typically the goal is to get the application to reach a certain point or perform some action in order to achieve a solution.

#### Common Examples:

- Finding Triggering Inputs:
Determine the exact input that makes a program return a specific value (e.g., True).
- Uncovering Hidden Secrets:
Disassemble a game to reveal hidden easter eggs or create cheat codes for a gameplay advantage.
- Optimizing Performance:
Modify a program's code to enhance its efficiency and enable it to run to completion.

 #### Typical Process:

- File Format Identification:
  
Recognize the type of binary file provided (e.g., PE, ELF, APK, .NET, Java, Python).

- Decompilation:
  
Transform the bytecode into a more readable format like Assembly or C using appropriate decompiler tools.

- Code Analysis:
  
     Meticulously scrutinize the decompiled code, focusing on:
       - Function identification, particularly the flag function containing the solution.
       - Loop and pattern recognition to uncover code behavior insights.
       - Algorithm identification, especially cryptographic techniques.
  
- Cryptography Understanding (if applicable):
  
Grasp the specific cryptographic algorithms employed to decipher encrypted elements.

- Terminal-Based Tools (optional):
  
Utilize debuggers like pwndbg for Assembly-level debugging and code flow manipulation.
Employ other terminal-based tools for tasks such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, or memory examination.
